    <br>

    This page contains short descriptions and links to some of the expository mathematics videos I've created over the years.<br>
    Most of them are posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpectralCollective">Spectral Collective</a>, a channel which I help to run,
    but I have also created a guest video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>.<br>

    <h2>Simulating and Analyzing Phase Change (2025)</h2>

    This is a two-part series describing the basics of phase transitions from a mathematical perspective.<br>
    In the first video (on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>), we give an intuitive proof of the Boltzmann formula and see how that leads to different<br>
    phases of matter, and we also explore some interesting behavior of the liquid&ndash;vapor model (also known as the Ising model).<br>
    In the second video (on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SpectralCollective">Spectral Collective</a>), we give a concise analysis of the mean-field version of this model (the Curie&ndash;Weiss model).<br>

    <h2>Card Shuffling (2024)</h2>

    In this video, we explore what people mean when they say that "7 shuffles suffice" and we give an elegant<br>
    proof of a slightly weaker bound, showing that "12 shuffles suffice" using only basic probability theory.<br>
    This video received an honorable mention in the \(\pi\)th Summer of Math Exposition (#SoMEpi).<br>

    <h2>The Longest Increasing Subsequence (2023)</h2>

    In a random permutation of the numbers \(1\) through \(n\), how long is the longest increasing subsequence?<br>
    This video explores the surprisingly deep and beautiful math that goes into answering this question.<br>
    This video received an honorable mention in the third Summer of Math Exposition (#SoME3).<br>

    <h2>Percolation (2022)</h2>

    This video provides an introduction to the subject of percolation on the two-dimensional lattice, and presents the Peierls argument,<br>
    which proves that the critical parameter is bounded away from 0 and 1. Created with help from <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/caioalves/homepage">Caio Alves</a> and <a href="https://www.aranka.uk">Aranka Hru&scaron;kov&aacute;</a>.<br>
    This video was selected as a winner in the second Summer of Math Exposition (#SoME2).<br>

    <h2>Sparse Graph Limits (2021)</h2>

    This is a two-part series on Benjamini-Schramm convergence of sparse graphs to unimodular random rooted graphs.<br>
    In the first video (joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/caioalves/homepage">Caio Alves</a> and <a href="https://www.aranka.uk">Aranka Hru&scaron;kov&aacute;</a>), we motivate the definition and go through a few examples.<br>
    In the second video, we work out a particularly enlightening example, the canopy tree.<br>
    The first video in this series received honorable mention in the first Summer of Math Exposition (#SoME1).<br>
