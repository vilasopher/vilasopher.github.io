    The ERGM is a Gibbs measure on graphs, where the probability of a particular graph is tilted according to subgraph counts,
    which has the effect of encouraging or discouraging the presence of certain subgraphs, like triangles.
    This model exhibits a <i>phase transition</i> and with high-temperature and low-temperature phase analogous to many other statistical mechanics models.
    In my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571">Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</a>,
    I prove that the <i>metastable wells</i> in the low-temperature phase behave qualitatively like copies of the full high-temperature phase, through the lens of concentration of measure.
    This validates a particular case of the folklore belief that low-temperature models can effectively be decomposed into regions exhibiting high-temperature behavior.<br>
