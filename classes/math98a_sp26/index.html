    <h3><a id="policies"></a>Course Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Behaviour</b>: this course is a fast 5 lecture course where we go from little-to-no idea how to program to
        being able to complete 128A assignments. As such, it is imperative that have a welcoming learning environment
        where everyone feels safe participating, trying, and making mistakes. Always be respectful, helpful, and
        encouraging of each other. Offensive/rude/hurtful comments and behaviour are not tolerated and may negatively
        impact your course grade. </li>
      <li><b>Grades</b>: there will be 4 homeworks and 1 project. Homeworks are worth 15 points each. They are graded
        for effort/completion. The project is worth 40 points and is graded for correctness. A pass in the class
        requires a score of 70% or better on the homeworks <em>and</em> 70% or better on the project.</li>
      <li><b>Extensions, etc.</b>: everyone has exactly 3 late days. Only one late day can be used per assignment (so
        that I can post solutions for the class before the next assignment is due). I know this course is fast. I want
        to keep everyone pushing through so that it is out of the way before the first round of midterms comes.</li>
      <li><b>Academic Integrity</b>. In this class we are all trying to learn a new language as fast as possible. Please
        work together on everything. When it comes to completing class assignments, some things that are explicitly not
        allowed are looking/copying someone else's code directly or from an online resource. Instead, collaborate by
        describing your algorithm with words, pictures, etc., but figure out the implementation details individually.
        For online resources, a good guideline is do not search the problem word for word. Instead, figure out one of
        the steps you need to solve the problem (for example, creating an n-by-n identity matrix).</li>
      <li><b>Inclusivity</b>. I want to help each and every one of you succeed, with each and every one of your diverse
        identities. If you ever feel unsafe or unwelcome, I truly want to know and fix what I am doing, even if you let
        me know through an e-mail or a friend or whatever feels comfortable.</li>
      <li><b>DSP</b>. If you are a student with DSP accommodations that apply to this course, please contact me ASAP.
        The course is very short, so it is very important that you let me know before it's too late.</li>
